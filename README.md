Hey so this is our rough outline for what we want to do for our project: We were thinking of playing around with the ISS API as our point of emphasis. Do something around the idea of tracking the ISS and and using google maps api and possibly a weather api as well and link them all together. For example, our app would be auto updated every minute or so and would show where the ISS is, then the user can input their location, or any location they want and it will display relative distance to the ISS. Also, it could display stupid/ pointless data such as having the user find out the walking distance to where the ISS is over at that point. We also tossed around the idea of having a weather api display what the current weather is like at the location nearest the ISS. We have a handful of other ideas that we could play around with, but this is our MVP. if we finish and polish that up, there are a bunch more ideas that we could include.
